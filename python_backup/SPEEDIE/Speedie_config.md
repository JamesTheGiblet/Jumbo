## Strategic Design Philosophy

### Speed-First Optimization

SPEEDY's entire design revolves around maximizing velocity while maintaining evolutionary intelligence:

1. **Lighter Chassis**: Reduced mass = faster acceleration and higher top speed
2. **Wide-Angle Sensing**: HC-SR04's cone vision detects obstacles approaching from sides at speed
3. **Real-Time Motion Feedback**: MPU-6050 provides actual velocity data, not just PWM duty cycle
4. **No Sleep Mode**: Always active, always fast-responding
5. **Minimal Sensor Load**: Only essential sensors to reduce processing overhead

### What the MPU-6050 Enables

The 6-axis IMU unlocks speed-specific capabilities:

**Accelerometer (3-axis):**

- Track **actual velocity** by integrating acceleration data
- Detect **sudden collisions** (rapid deceleration events)
- Monitor **surface friction changes** (drift detection)
- Calculate **real distance traveled** for fitness scoring

**Gyroscope (3-axis):**

- Measure **angular velocity** during turns
- Optimize **turn sharpness** without tipping
- Detect **wheel slip** (commanded vs. actual rotation)
- Enable **drift correction** in real-time

### Genome Parameters for SPEEDY

SPEEDY's evolutionary genome includes speed-specific parameters:

```cpp
struct SpeedyGenome {
  // Standard parameters (inherited from WHEELIE)
  int motorSpeed = 240;          // Start higher than WHEELIE
  int turnSpeed = 180;
  int backupDuration = 400;      // Shorter - faster reactions
  int turnDuration = 250;        // Quicker turns
  
  // Speed-specific parameters
  int maxSafeSpeed = 255;        // Speed where stability maintained
  int collisionThreshold = 50;   // Accel change indicating crash (m/s²)
  float driftTolerance = 0.15;   // Acceptable path deviation
  int emergencyBrakeDecel = 200; // How hard to brake on obstacle
  
  // Standard evolution metadata
  unsigned long successCount = 0;
  unsigned long failureCount = 0;
  float fitnessScore = 0.0;
  unsigned long generation = 0;
};
```

### Fitness Function for SPEEDY

Speed-optimized fitness prioritizes velocity and efficiency:

```cpp
void calculateSpeedyFitness() {
  // Standard metrics
  float successRate = obstaclesCleared / obstaclesEncountered;
  float escapeRate = trapEscapes / timesTrapped;
  
  // Speed-specific metrics
  float avgVelocity = totalDistanceTraveled / totalTime; // From MPU-6050
  float efficiency = distanceTraveled / energyUsed;      // Distance per watt
  float stabilityScore = 1.0 - (crashCount / totalManeuvers);
  
  // Weighted combination (speed emphasized)
  fitnessScore = 
    (successRate * 0.30) +
    (avgVelocity * 0.35) +    // Speed is king
    (efficiency * 0.20) +
    (stabilityScore * 0.15);
}
```

## Hurdles to Overcome

Lessons learned from WHEELIE applied to SPEEDY's development:

### Anticipated Challenges

1. **I2C Bus Contention**: MPU-6050 requires continuous high-speed polling. HC-SR04 on separate GPIO prevents I2C conflicts that would occur with VL53L0X.

2. **High-Speed Stability**: At higher speeds, small obstacles can cause crashes. The gyroscope will detect instability (tilt) before disaster, allowing emergency braking.

3. **Stopping Distance**: At 235+ motor speed, reaction time becomes critical. HC-SR04's 30ms cycle time + 50ms processing = ~3-5cm traveled before response. Evolution must optimize `emergencyBrakeDecel`.

4. **Turn Dynamics**: Front-wheel drive can understeer at speed. Evolution may need to *increase* turn duration (counterintuitive) or add multi-stage turns (brake → turn → accelerate).

5. **Battery Drain**: Higher speeds = more current draw. Voltage monitoring may be needed to adjust speed as batteries deplete.

### Solutions from WHEELIE Experience

✅ **Star Grounding**: Already proven to eliminate motor noise  
✅ **EEPROM Persistence**: Genome survives power cycles  
✅ **Strategy Library**: 20-slot memory works well  
✅ **Emotional States**: Proven framework, no changes needed  
✅ **RGB LED Expression**: Visual feedback is valuable

## Expected Behavioral Differences

Based on WHEELIE's evolution, we predict SPEEDY will develop:

| Trait | WHEELIE | SPEEDY (Predicted) |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| **Top Speed** | 235 PWM | **255 PWM** (maxed out) |
| **Obstacle Threshold** | 175mm | **120mm** (closer detection due to speed) |
| **Turn Style** | Smooth arcs | **Sharp flicks** (minimize time not moving forward) |
| **Risk Tolerance** | Moderate | **High** (aggressive, fast recovery) |
| **Communication Style** | Melodic, varied | **Short, rapid bursts** (less time for signaling) |
| **Emotional Expression** | Balanced | **High confidence, low frustration** (speed builds confidence) |

### Personality Hypothesis

**If WHEELIE became aggressive and GRABBER became cautious based on their roles, SPEEDY should become:**

- **Reckless**: Prioritizes speed over caution
- **Opportunistic**: Takes risks WHEELIE wouldn't
- **Impatient**: Short backup times, quick decisions
- **Confident**: High-speed successes reinforce boldness

**This will be tested empirically through evolution!** 🧬

## Success Metrics

SPEEDY will be considered successful when:

- ✅ **Top speed ≥ 2x WHEELIE's average** (target: 1.5+ m/s)
- ✅ **Collision detection working** (stops within 2cm of unexpected obstacles)
- ✅ **Fitness score > 0.70** by generation 30
- ✅ **Distinct personality** from WHEELIE (measured by parameter divergence)
- ✅ **Stable at max speed** (no uncontrolled crashes)
- ✅ **Swarm coordination** (communicates with WHEELIE effectively)

## Research Questions

SPEEDY will help answer:

1. **Does speed alone drive personality?** Will SPEEDY become reckless just from moving fast?
2. **Can evolution optimize for conflicting goals?** (Speed vs. safety)
3. **How does velocity affect learning?** Do faster bots learn different strategies?
4. **What's the upper limit?** How fast can a bot go before evolution can't compensate?

**The answers will shape the rest of the swarm.** 🚀
