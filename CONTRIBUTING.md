# ü§ù Contributing to Project Jumbo

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Project Jumbo! It's people like you that make open source and collaborative research so rewarding. This project is an active exploration into embodied AI, and every contribution, no matter how small, is valuable.

Please take a moment to review these guidelines to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

[Project README](../README.md)

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior. (Note: A `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` will be added soon).

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, from writing code and designing hardware to improving documentation and running experiments.

### üêõ Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug in the code or a problem with the hardware design, please open a new issue.

When filing a bug report, please include:

- A clear and descriptive title.
- A detailed description of the problem.
- Steps to reproduce the bug.
- What you expected to happen and what actually happened.
- Information about your setup (e.g., ESP32 board version, OS, library versions).

### ‚ú® Suggesting Enhancements

Have an idea for a new feature, a better algorithm, or a new bot? We'd love to hear it! Please open a new issue to suggest an enhancement.

Provide a clear description of the enhancement and explain why it would be beneficial to the project.

### üõ†Ô∏è Pull Requests

Ready to contribute code, documentation, or design files? Follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.
2. **Create a new branch** for your changes:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/YourAmazingFeature
    ```

3. **Make your changes** and commit them with a descriptive message. We recommend following the Conventional Commits specification.

    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: Add new sensor fusion algorithm"
    ```

4. **Push your branch** to your fork:

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/YourAmazingFeature
    ```

5. **Open a Pull Request** back to the main `project_jumbo` repository.

Please provide a clear title and description for your Pull Request, explaining the "what" and "why" of your changes.

## Areas for Contribution

We welcome contributions in all areas, but here are some specific ideas based on our Roadmap:

- **üß¨ Evolution Algorithm Improvements:** Can you make the genetic algorithm more efficient? Propose new mutation strategies or fitness functions.
- **üó£Ô∏è Language Analysis Tools:** Create scripts (e.g., in Python) to parse bot communication logs and visualize the emergent language.
- **üìä Data Visualization:** Improve the web dashboard or create new ways to visualize the swarm's evolution and behavior.
- **ü§ñ New Bot Designs:** Help design and build the next members of the swarm, like `SPEEDY` or `GRABBER`. This includes hardware selection, chassis design, and firmware integration.
- **üìñ Documentation:** Good documentation is crucial! Help us write clearer setup guides, hardware tutorials, wiring diagrams, or API references.
- **üß™ Experimental Ideas:** Design and propose new experiments to test the swarm's capabilities. What new challenges can we give them?

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move file to..." not "Moves file to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### C++ Style

Please try to follow the existing code style for consistency. (A more formal style guide will be published soon).
